# Signals and Systems Course Project

This reposity is for the project of Signals and Systems Course, Feb 2021 - July 2021, Instructor: Dr. Babak Khalaj

## Phase 1

This phase is just an introduction to image processing, filters, template matching, line detection and finally making a hybrid image as the goal of this phase. 

The code for this phase is in a zip file \(because this phase was created before the github repository being created.\)

## Phase 2

This phase's main focus is on sound processing using various filters and signal processing tools.

In the first part the noise of a noisy audio track is filtered in order to create an audio with a higher quality and after that another audio track which has been encrypted before is decrypted using some bandpass filters and rewinding the audio.

Second part contains 3D audio such as creating a moving audio which moves between the two speakers of the device, creating a feeling of a 3D sound rotating in around us. Another thing which is done in this part is creating a Meaningful 3D audio. This means combining two different audio tracks such that it seems like both of these audios are coming from a different location simultaniously.

In the third part, an echo of a sound is created. In the tested example I used my own recording and created an echo of it by adding to it some shifted versions of the same signal with a damped amplitude.

Finally, in the fourth part of this phase, the phaser effect is demonstrated. This effect creates a sound that is often heard in many sci-fi movies like the sound of a lightsaber in Starwars Movies.

## Phase 3

In this phase, both of the tools used in phase 1 and 2 are combined and a music player is created which gets musics sheets as an image input and gives the music based on that sheet as an output. Some test sheets have been given to it before and the output related to those sheets are currently accessible at directory "Phase3/results/". Hopefully anybody who listens to them, enjoys.
